# Signal R Redis
This is the sample application for the blog titled [Scaling Signal R Core Web Applications on Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@ashwin027/scaling-signal-r-core-web-applications-on-kubernetes-fca32d787c7d).

## Local Build
* Build and run the app through visual studio or from the command line using the dotnet cli
* Navigate to the Client App folder and run `npm install` and then `npm start` to run the angular app.

Access the app from the browser using the URL [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

To deploy to a kubernetes cluster without building locally, follow the instructions on the [blog](https://medium.com/@ashwin027/scaling-signal-r-core-web-applications-on-kubernetes-fca32d787c7d).
